Every program has a shape. On a small scale, this shape is determined by its division into functions and the blocks inside those functions. Programmers have a lot of freedom in the way they structure their programs. Shape follows more from the taste of the programmer than from the programâ€™s intended functionality.

You may have heard of static-site generators before. A static-site generator simply takes your pre-compiled (and pre-processed) languages like Haml, Jade, Sass, LESS, Stylus, CoffeeScript, and others, and compiles them into the equivalent language that is understood by the browser; HTML, CSS.

Programmers have a lot of freedom in the way they structure their programs.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

def say_hi()
  puts "Hi!"
end
say_hi()
#=> prints 'Hi!' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
