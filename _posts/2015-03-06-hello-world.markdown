Hi Guys! This is my very first blog post and I couldn’t be more excited to start writing my thoughts about everything, although primarily about Software Development of course. I’m pretty sure I’ll learn a bunch of things from you guys and hopefully my posts will be useful to help you learn some new things as well.

If you just ran into this post and want to know a bit more about me, have a look at my <a href="/about">About Myself</a> page and you’ll find out.

For those who wish to know about how I built this blog, it’s a simply static HTML, using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, hosted on <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a> and it totally rocks! Basically it’s a static site generator written in Ruby that takes the content, renders it using Markdown and Liquid templates and finally generates your production-ready static website. I’m not going to explain step by step how to setup your own jekyll website because it’s really simple. You can start by reading the documentation <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home" target="_blank">here</a>.

I think that’s all for my first post. I’ll try to keep a frequency of at least 1 post per week. I hope you guys enjoy it! See ya!
